            First on this list, this famous rat is no one to mess with. Splinter, the famous martial arts master turned to a rat via a radioactive substance who later would raise 4 beautiful boys, is the star of the TMNT franchise. Even though his boys get more screen time he is the obvious star. With the skills to both teach and kick ass he was an easy contender to have on this epic list.
